# GETUP! - An App for the Passively Active
Also a SYDE/BME hackathon project


## What it is
A website that uses facial recognition to tell you when to take breaks
- Uses computer webcam to determine if the user is in front of the computer
- Allows for users to choose time intervals until break session

## How it flows
1. Website home - Landing page, what the user sees when they first arrive
2. Permissions - Prompt to accept permissions to use device camera
3. Instructions page - Instructs user about how it works and how to change different times intervals
4. (If possible) Train the model to recognize the user's face using profile shots or live training data
5. Functioning service page - When the model is running, basically the app is being used
6. Break time page - When the user needs to go take a break
